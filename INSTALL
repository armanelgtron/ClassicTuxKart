TUXKART INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INSTALLATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure that you have the following packages installed:

    * OpenGL (or Mesa 3.0 or later)
    * PLIB version 1.8.0 or later . 

Unpack the files from the tarball like this:

  tar xzf tuxkart-*.tar.gz
  cd tuxkart-*


(where '*' is the version of TuxKart you downloaded - eg 0.4.0) ...and then:

  ./configure
  make


You can run the game from the directory you downloaded it into - or (as
'root') you can install it into /usr/local/share/games/tuxkart by typing;

 make install


But it didn't work!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, the most common (by FAR) reason for problems is that your OpenGL/Mesa
is incorrectly installed - so before you complain to any of the PLIB or
TuxKart mailing lists, first try running one of the example programs
that comes with your OpenGL implementation - or one of the Mesa or GLUT
sample programs.

If you those examples run OK - then go to the PLIB home page and download
the PLIB examples.

If THOSE run correctly - but TuxKart doesn't then please get in touch with
the TuxKart mailing list and we'll do our best to get you up and racing.
